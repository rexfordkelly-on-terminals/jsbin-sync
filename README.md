# JSBin Sync

This is an (unofficial) implementation for synchronizing files to [JSBin.com](https://jsbin.com) via its [API](https://jsbin.com/help/experimental-features#api).

While JSBin currently allows maintaining a bin's content in a [gist](http://jsbin.com/help/import-gists) and [dropbox](http://jsbin.com/help/dropbox), there is no built-in way to maintain documents anywhere else. Using this tool, a bin's content can be maintained *anywhere* (e.g. a git repository) and simply be "deployed" to to JSBin for "production use".

`jsbin-sync` started out as a utility to *upload* local files to JSBin.com, but has since grown into a full featured interface covering upload, download, backup, listing and deleting of bins.
